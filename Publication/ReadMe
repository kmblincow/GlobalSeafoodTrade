FMI_GTAMatch.csv - full list of FMI values matched to GTA reporters and partners
IntermediateFMIiCalc2.xlsx - data entered into supplementary table on calculations made for irregular trade partners
FAO_FMI_class.csv - FAO data with corresponding FMI values added, proportion of production and proportion of imports calculated
Final_FAOFMI_prop.csv - consumption, production, and import FMIs combined
Final_FAOFMI_prop_Wild.csv - consumption, production, and import FMIs combined for wild capture
Import_FMI_prop.csv - import FMI data
Import_FMI_prop_Wild.csv - import FMI for wild capture data
FAOMetrics.csv - data including how UN classifies FAO countries, such as region and developing v. developed

Third Party Data (see data availability statement for how to access):
2012_all.csv - 2012 GTA data
2013_all.csv - 2013 GTA data
2014_all.csv - 2014 GTA data
2015_all.csv - 2015 GTA data
2016_all.csv - 2016 GTA data
2017_all.csv - 2017 GTA data
GTA_FAOmatch.csv - cleaned GTA data that can be combined with FAO data
GTA_FAOmatch_Wild.csv - cleaned Wild capture GTA data that can be combined with FAO data

Scripts listed in order of implementation:
CountryClassification.R - cleans FAO dataset and prepares for it to be combined with GTA data (generates FAO_FMI_class.csv)
GTA_Conversion_Cleaning.R - cleans GTA dataset and prepares for it to be combined with FAO data (generates GTA_FAOmatch.csv)
GTA_Conversion_Cleaning_Wild.R - same as GTA_Conversion_Cleaning.R except includes filtering of products potentially associated with aquaculture (generates GTA_FAOmatch_Wild.csv)
FMI_GapFilling.R - aligns FMI country names with GTA country names and expands gap filling to all countries/groups in GTA data (generates FMI_GTAMatch.csv)

Import_FMI_calculation.R - calculate import FMI for each Reporter based on their Partners relative production (generates Import_FMI_prop.csv)
Import_FMI_calculation_Wild.R - calculate import FMI for each Reporter based on their Partners relative production of wild capture products (generates Import_FMI_prop_Wild.csv)

Consumption_FMI_Calculation.R - calculate the consumption FMI using three different methods (generates Final_FAOFMI_prop.csv)
Consumption_FMI_Calculation_Wild.R - calculate the consumption FMI using three different methods using wild capture data (generates Final_FAOFMI_prop_Wild.csv)

Q1_FMIpvFMIc.R - calculates differences between FMIc and FMIp, runs linear models (generates Fig. 1 & 2, Table 1 & 2)
Q1_FMIpvFMIc_Wild.R - calculates differences between FMIc and FMIp, runs linear models, and generates Figures for wild capture products ((generates Fig. 1 & 2, Table 1 & 2 - WILD)

Q3_ReporterCommunityAnalysis.R - find and plot the countries that account for the most imports/exports (generates Fig. 3)
Q3_ReporterCommunityAnalysis_Wild.R - find and plot the countries that account for the most imports/exports (generates Fig. 3_Wild)

USImportsMapFigureCode_USCentered_Top25.R - generates the US centered map of imports and associated calculations (Fig. 3a)
USImportsMapFigureCode_USCentered_Top25_Wild.R - generates the US centered map of imports and associated calculations with Wild capture data (Fig. 3a - Wild)
ChinaExportsMapFigureCode_ChinaCentered_Top25.R - generates the China centered map of exports and associated calculations (Fig. 3b)
ChinaExportsMapFigureCode_ChinaCentered_Top25_Wild.R - generates the China centered map of exports and associated calculations with wild capture data (Fig. 3b - Wild)

FAOvGTAplot.R - generates plot comparing FAO and GTA imports
